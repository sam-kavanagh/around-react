NodeJS

Node.js is an open-source, cross-platform runtime environment that allows developers to create all kinds of server-side tools and applications in JavaScript.
Node. js is primarily used for non-blocking, event-driven servers, due to its single-threaded nature.
It's used for traditional web sites and back-end API services.

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
